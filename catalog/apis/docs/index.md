# TMF Product Catalog Management API

Provides a standardized solution for rapidly adding partnersâ€™ products to an existing Catalog. It brings the capability for Service Providers to directly feed partners systems with the technical description of the products they propose to them.

The TMF Product Catalog Management API exposes a number of APIs that are consumed by other APIs. It reads and writes a backend database (tmf-product-catalog-management-api-db).
